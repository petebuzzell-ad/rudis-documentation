# Requests & Investigations

This directory contains ad-hoc requests, investigations, and tasks from clients and the Arcadia team that are **not yet ready for the main documentation hub**.

## Purpose

Use subdirectories here to organize work-in-progress requests that need:
- Research and investigation
- Client/team input gathering
- Results compilation
- Decision on whether content should be promoted to long-term documentation

## Structure

Each subdirectory should represent a single task, request, or investigation. Use descriptive names like:
- `performance-optimization-request-2025-11-01`
- `client-checkout-issue-investigation`
- `arcadia-team-theme-update-request`

## Workflow

1. **Create subdirectory** for the new request/investigation
2. **Add notes, findings, and research** as you work
3. **Compile results** when complete
4. **Promote to docs/** if the information is relevant for long-term documentation
5. **Archive or remove** if not needed long-term

## Notes

- Keep this directory lean — move completed work to `docs/` or archive
- Use clear naming conventions for easy navigation
- Include dates in directory names when relevant for chronological organization
