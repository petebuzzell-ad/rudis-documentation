# RUDIS Technical Documentation Hub — Case Study

**Client:** RUDIS  
**Platform:** Shopify Plus  
**Engagement:** Technical Documentation Implementation  
**Methodology:** ARCDIG-DOCS v1.2.0  
**Timeline:** November 2-4, 2025 (~48 hours)  
**Date:** November 2025

## Executive Summary

Arcadia Digital delivered a comprehensive technical documentation hub for RUDIS, a Shopify Plus eCommerce platform serving the wrestling and combat sports market. The documentation system transformed platform knowledge from fragmented audit files and scattered code exports into a unified, evidence-based knowledge base accessible to developers, operations teams, business users, and AI assistants.

**Key Results:**
- **2,086+ lines** of evidence-based documentation
- **14 third-party integrations** fully documented
- **Performance baseline** established with Core Web Vitals analysis
- **WCAG 2.2 AA compliance** roadmap created
- **Zero handoff meetings required** — complete static memory file enables autonomous onboarding
- **2 major investigations** completed with automated analysis tools and published reports
- **Complete delivery in ~48 hours** from initial discovery to production-ready documentation hub

## The Challenge

RUDIS operated a complex Shopify Plus store with significant technical depth but lacked centralized documentation. Knowledge existed in silos:

**Fragmented Knowledge:**
- Theme audits scattered across multiple prework documents
- Third-party integration details buried in theme code
- Performance data in CSV reports without context or analysis
- Accessibility findings isolated from remediation plans
- No clear path for developers to understand platform architecture

**Operational Impact:**
- Onboarding new developers required multiple handoff meetings
- Business users lacked clear guides for content management
- Performance issues identified but not prioritized
- Accessibility violations documented but remediation unclear
- AI assistants had no reliable source of truth for platform queries

**Business Risk:**
- Knowledge concentrated in few individuals
- No documentation for long-term maintenance
- Difficult to scale development work
- Compliance gaps (accessibility) not actionable

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Evidence-Based Documentation

Unlike generic documentation templates, RUDIS documentation is built entirely from actual codebase analysis, real performance data, and verified integrations.

**Example:** Integration documentation (`/Users/pete/dev/shopify/rudis-documentation/docs/integrations.md`) includes code references showing exactly where and how each app integrates with the theme.

### 2. Multi-Audience Architecture

Single documentation system serves four distinct audiences with role-specific navigation and content depth.

**Result:** Developers don't wade through business workflows; business users don't get lost in code examples.

### 3. Static Memory File

`/Users/pete/dev/shopify/rudis-documentation/README.md` serves as complete context for AI assistants and developers, enabling autonomous onboarding without handoff meetings.

**Impact:** New team members can understand the entire platform from a single file.

### 4. Business-First Writing

Technical documentation written for business clarity without sacrificing technical accuracy.

**Example:** Performance metrics include business impact explanations, not just technical thresholds.

### 5. Actionable Remediation

Issues identified with clear, prioritized action plans — not just problem statements.

**Example:** Accessibility violations include code references, implementation steps, and testing checklists.
