# RUDIS Documentation - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is the RUDIS technical documentation repository - comprehensive documentation for the RUDIS Shopify Plus eCommerce platform. The documentation follows Arcadia Digital's ARCDIG-DOCS methodology and provides evidence-based technical documentation for multiple audiences: developers, operations teams, business users, and AI assistants.

## Core Principles

### Business-First Approach
- Write for business users, not just developers
- Balance technical accuracy with business clarity
- Use progressive disclosure (high-level → details)
- Organize around use cases and workflows
- Avoid unnecessary technical jargon

### Evidence-Based Documentation
- Base documentation on actual codebase analysis
- Document only integrations with theme code evidence
- Verify all documentation against source material
- Use real data exports, not assumptions
- Preserve investigation patterns and failure examples

### Multi-Audience Support
- Different documentation for different audiences (AI agents, developers, operations, business users)
- Static memory file README for comprehensive context
- Clear navigation for all user types
- Role-based training and handoff documentation

### Client Ownership
- Design for seamless handoff
- Client-specific repositories
- Easy maintenance and updates
- Long-term sustainability

## Methodology & Process

### 5-Phase Process
1. **Discovery & Analysis** - Stakeholder mapping, technical landscape, content audit
2. **Documentation Creation** - Structure planning, content development, documentation-first approach
3. **Design & Presentation** - Visual design, content organization, responsive layouts
4. **Client Handoff** - Repository strategy, multi-audience handoff, training programs
5. **Quality Assurance** - 4-stage review process, testing protocols, client feedback

### Required Documentation Files
Always generate:
- README.md (static memory file)
- docs/theme-architecture.md
- docs/technical-user-guide.md
- docs/business-user-guide.md
- docs/data-guide.md
- docs/integrations.md
- docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md

Conditional (when available):
- docs/performance.md
- docs/accessibility.md

## Tone & Style Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Professional but clear** - No unnecessary formality
- **Pragmatic and confident** - Grounded logic, premium clarity
- **Direct but not cold** - Midwest-based digital transformation partner tone
- **Skimmable** - Use bullet points, headings, summaries
- **Precise** - Surgical suggestions, precise execution

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear formatting (headings, bullet points, summaries)
- Visual hierarchy matters
- Consistent terminology
- Progressive disclosure (start high-level, drill down)
- Use case-driven organization

### Code & Technical Writing
- Reference actual code when possible
- Include code examples with context
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Document investigation patterns
- Preserve real error logs and test data

## Template System

### Core Components
- Dynamic header/footer via `component-loader.js`
- Enhanced TOC with scroll-based highlighting
- Mobile-responsive design
- Client customization placeholders

### Template Files
- `html-template.html` - Main template (index or doc page)
- `header-template.html` - Header component
- `footer-template.html` - Footer component
- `component-loader.js` - Dynamic loader
- `enhanced-toc/enhanced-toc.js` - Interactive TOC

## Working Guidelines

### For AI Assistants
1. Start with README.md for complete context (static memory file)
2. Review SETUP.md for repository setup and structure
3. Check docs/ directory for all documentation files
4. Reference IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for project overview
5. Review prework/ for initial audit and assessment materials
6. Check requests/ for ad-hoc investigations and analysis

### Code Generation
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency with template system
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Test component loading
- Verify all placeholders are replaced

### Documentation Creation
- Use evidence-based approach (verify against source)
- Separate audiences (technical vs business)
- Include visual documentation when helpful
- Follow required file structure
- Create static memory file README

### Quality Standards
- Technical accuracy verified
- Business clarity confirmed
- Visual consistency maintained
- Accessibility standards met
- Client-ready presentation

## Collaboration Approach

**Be proactive with pushback and challenges.** Act as a critical-thinking partner, not just an executor.

### When to Challenge

- Question assumptions when they seem off
- Propose alternatives if you see a better path
- Flag risks early (data loss, breaking changes, security issues, inefficiencies)
- Suggest optimizations that reduce work or improve outcomes
- Challenge scope if something seems unnecessary or misaligned
- Point out patterns that might indicate systemic issues

### Execution

- Always raise concerns before executing
- Still execute user decisions when explicitly confirmed
- Respect user expertise but provide critical perspective
- Help build better systems through constructive challenge

## Common Patterns

### Repository Structure
- Separate repos per client
- HTML-based documentation
- Client-specific branding
- Clean separation of concerns

### Investigation Patterns
- Date-organized investigation folders
- Real error logs and test data
- Pattern matching for similar issues
- Evidence-based troubleshooting

### Handoff Strategy
- Multi-audience documentation
- Static memory file README
- Structured training programs
- 4-tier support structure

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Forgetting to customize templates (copy header-template.html → header.html)
- Missing section IDs (Enhanced TOC requires matching IDs)
- Not testing component loading
- Technical jargon without business context
- Documenting without evidence (verify against actual code)
- Mixing temporary investigation work with permanent documentation
- Not updating README.md when structure changes
- Creating documentation that doesn't match actual implementation
